    <h2>Project Description:</h2>

    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and visually engaging dashboard for analyzing the stock performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) over various time frames. The dashboard aims to empower users, including investors and analysts, with a clear view of Apple’s stock price movements, percentage changes, volume trends, and historical performance indicators to make informed decisions based on recent market data.</p>

    <h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
    <p>Data preparation involved gathering historical stock data for Apple Inc., including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily closing prices, trading volumes, and price changes.</li>
        <li>Calculation of percentage changes in stock prices over specific time frames, such as 1-day, 5-day, 1-month, 3-month, and yearly intervals.</li>
        <li>Time series data was cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy and continuity, with the necessary transformations performed to integrate it into Power BI seamlessly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Analysis and Visualizations:</h3>
    <p>The analysis was conducted in Power BI with custom visuals, filters, and time frame selection options.</p>

    <h4>Price Trends:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A candlestick chart was created to display daily stock price movements over time, showing open, high, low, and close prices for each day.</li>
        <li>Users can observe the trend of stock prices, including bullish and bearish patterns, to understand the stock's performance over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Percentage Change:</h4>

        <li>A prominently displayed percentage change metric highlights Apple’s stock performance over the selected period (e.g., 3-month change of -2.95% as shown).</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Volume Analysis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Volume bars beneath the candlestick chart represent trading volume, with green and red colors denoting buying and selling pressure, respectively.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Date Range Filters:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can select specific date ranges (1 day, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, year-to-date, 1 year, 2 years, or 5 years) to dynamically update the dashboard for different analysis windows.</li>
        <li>Additionally, users can zoom into specific time periods to gain a more granular view of recent stock activity.</li>
    </ul>
